                                Samaritans is committed to safeguarding our service, which includes carrying out background checks
                                on certain volunteer and staff roles. This role threfore requires a criminal record check to be
                                carried out. You will be given more information about this separately. A criminal record will not
                                normally prevent an applicant from being appointed as a volunteer. We will judge each case on its
                                merits and not discriminate unfairly against any applicant on the basis of a conviction or
                                criminal record information disclosed to us. If you would like to find out more,
