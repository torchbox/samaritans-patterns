# Front end tooling

This set of tooling should form the basis for any new wagtail projects. It can also be used for custom django builds - simply copy the `static_src` directory from here to your build.

## What's required

You can run the tooling within the VM where Node.js is pre-installed, but if you are using Mac OS, you will likely have issues with performance of `npm install` and other `npm` commands. It is adviced to Mac OS users to have node on the host machine.
 To install node on the host machine we recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Once you have `nvm` installed simply run `nvm install` to install and activate the version of node required for the project. Refer to the [`nvm` documentation](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) for more details about available commands.


## Setting up a new project from the wagtail-kit tooling

* From inside the `static_src` directory, run `npm install`.
* This will create:
    - a set of files inside `node_modules` which should be excluded from the repo
    - a `package-lock.json` file, which will record the exact version of node pacakages used.
* Ensure you commit the package-lock.json file to your repo.
* It may be advisable to upgrade the packages to their latest versions (see Using npm below)

Note that for easier maintenance the package-lock.json file is not committed to the `wagtail-kit` repo, but it *should* be committed in any new project created from `wagtail-kit` to ensure consistency between the packages used when different developers are working on the same project.

## What's included

* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with [auto-prefixing](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
* [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) for autoreloading.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io) for ES2015 support with module loading.
* Consideration for images, currently copying the directory only - to avoid slowdowns and non-essential dependancies. We encourage using SVG for UI vectors and pre-optimised UI photograph assets.
* [Build commands](#build-scripts) for generating testable or deployable assets only
* Sass linting with `sass-lint`
* JS linting with `eslint`

## Developing with it

* To start the development environment, run `npm start` - to stop this process press `ctrl + c`.
* This will start Browsersync and make the project available at `http://localhost:3000/html/`. If another process is using this port, check terminal for an updated URL. You can change this configuation by modifying the `browsersync.config.js` file, documented here https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options.
* Source files for developing your project are in `static_src` and the distribution folder for the compiled assets is `static_compiled`. Don't make direct changes to the `static_compiled` directory as they will be overwritten.

Note that the build, debug and start commands will all rebuild node-sass before running the watch commands. This is because of differences between the way node-sass is installed when running vagrant up and when running `npm install` on the host machine.

### Using npm

* Install all packages from `package.json`: `npm install`
* Add new packages that are only required for development, e.g. tooling: `npm install --save-dev package_name` (this will add it to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` too)
* Add new packages required in production, e.g. react: `npm install --save-prod package_name`
* To upgrade packages run `npm update package_name` or `npm update` to update them all.

## Deploying it

### Build scripts

To only build assets for either development or production you can use

 * `npm run build` To build development assets
 * `npm run build:prod` To build assets with minification and vendor prefixes

### Debug script

To test production, minified and vendor prefixed assets you can use

 * `npm run debug` To develop with a simple http server, no browsersync and production assets

## Using and updating the tooling in wagtail-kit

You can remove this section from the readme file for new builds.

To run the tooling inside the `wagtail-kit` build, ensure that you run `npm install` from insdie the built image, i.e. `wagtail-kit/built_image/ck_repo_name/ck_repo_name/static_src`

The easiest way to install new packages is to run `npm install --save-dev package_name` in `wagtail-kit/built_image/ck_repo_name/ck_repo_name/static_src`, but then copy the resultant changes to `package.json` over to `/wagtail-kit/samsnet/samsnet/static_src`.

Changes to the config files can be made directly in `/wagtail-kit/samsnet/samsnet/static_src` If you make updates to either the config files or package.json ensure you update both the default versions and the react verisons.
